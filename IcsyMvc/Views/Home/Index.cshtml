                <p class="featured-text">However, without resources to guide and stimulate their learning, children's natural curiosity can be stamped out and misdirected. This is especially true for children facing the pressures of poverty, discrimination, and violence.</p>
                <p class="featured-text">That's why ICSY was created – to connect kids who face many stressors and distractions with opportunities to learn about science in safe, fun, and engaging ways.</p>
